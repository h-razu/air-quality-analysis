  The data preprocessing steps included the following operations:
  - **Handling Missing Values**: Numerical columns were imputed with the mean value, and categorical columns with the most frequent value.
  - **Outlier Handling**: Outliers in the numerical columns were handled using Winsorization (clipping values to the 1st and 99th percentiles).
  - **Timestamp Creation**: A `timestamp` column was created by combining the year, month, day, and hour columns, and set as the index.
  - **Air Quality Index (AQI) Calculation**: AQI values were calculated for various pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, O3) based on predefined breakpoints. The highest AQI among all pollutants was assigned as the final AQI for each record.
  - **AQI Category Creation**: The AQI values were categorized into 6 levels: 'Good', 'Moderate', 'Unhealthy for sensitive group', 'Unhealthy', 'Very Unhealthy', and 'Hazardous'.
  - **Pollution Source Estimation**: Additional columns were created to estimate pollution from vehicles (based on PM2.5, PM10, NO2, CO) and industrial sources (based on SO2, O3).
